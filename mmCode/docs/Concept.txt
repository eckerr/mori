The Mori concept
The following interview was conducted after our website Mori was launched in
the future.
--------------------------
Please introduce yourself.
--------------------------

My name is Sammi Adams. I have lots of friends and come from a big family. I am
not very good at remembering dates.  In particular, there have been a number
of friends and relatives that impacted my life in profound and meaningful ways.
Several of these people are no longer with us.

I really appreciate the role they played in my life and wish to remember them.
Sometimes I'd like to go visit their grave.  I don't always remember where they
are buried or even which cemetery.  Often when I attempt to visit, the cemetery
office is closed and I am not sure where to look to find their gravesite.

This is particularly frustrating for me. It is even embarrassing at times when
someone asks "How long ago did your Mother die?", or "How old was your Father
when he passed?". Maybe other people struggle with this as well, but I can't
help but feel embarrassed that I should know this stuff. After all, I really
 do care about them.  It is not that I don't.

Other times, I find myself thinking about them and can't seem to remember how
long they have been gone. Or, I wonder how old they would be now if they were
still with us.  Sometimes, I just wish I had a small picture of them to look at.
 Maybe even, a picture of them that I am particularly fond of and like to
 remember them by.

To be frank, it's not just the people that are gone that I mess up dates with.
I am at a near total loss at remembering the birthdays and ages of my sibling's
children.  They are clearly still with us, and very important to me, yet I
can't help but feel bad that I can't even begin to keep their ages and birthdays
straight.

Same goes for my important friends.  I just wish I had a better handle on this.

Based on what you saw, what is your opinion about Mori?
-------------------------------------------------------
I think it is a fantastic idea. Having easy access to some basic information
about these important people in my life allows me to think about them without
feeling a pang of guilt that I have forgotten dates and details that a truly
good friend would have remembered.  In fact, seeing their picture again, I
am reminded of how they have personally touched my life and it enables me to
reconnect with that warm feeling they have created in my life.

I find having the app, actually allows me to visit with them more often, both
physically and virtually in my thoughts and feelings. Now I can find
where they are located with confidence and feel more at ease visiting them.
Even if I can't get out to see them, I find I think about them more often.
Oddly enough, it leaves me with the feeling that they are still watching over
me, in a quit peaceful sort of way. I know that may sound weird, but it is
kind of a nice feeling.

---------------------------------------------------------
Can you tell us briefly some of the features you noticed?
---------------------------------------------------------
Sure, I think this is a pretty decent app where you can:

- Access it from your desktop, laptop, mobile device, or web.
- Gives a thumbnail picture and some basic facts about dates and such
- Can even keep personal notes and bio information about the person
- Keeps the details of where they are buried in one convenient place
- finds all the people I know at that cemetery, so I can visit several if I want
Everything is easy. I doesn't take a math wiz to figure it out.
